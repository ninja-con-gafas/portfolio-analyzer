- **pip**: Comes pre-installed with Python.
- **Git**: [Install Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/portfolio-analyzer.git
cd portfolio-analyzer
```

### Set envrionment variables

Create a `.env` file and set values to following variables:

```bash
AIRFLOW_ADMIN_EMAIL=""
AIRFLOW_ADMIN_FIRST_NAME=""
AIRFLOW_ADMIN_LAST_NAME=""
AIRFLOW_ADMIN_PASSWORD=""
AIRFLOW_ADMIN_USERNAME=""
AIRFLOW_WEBSERVER_SECRET_KEY=""
POSTGRES_AIRFLOW_DATABASE=""
POSTGRES_AIRFLOW_PASSWORD=""
POSTGRES_AIRFLOW_USERNAME=""
POSTGRES_USERNAME=""
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=""
POSTGRES_PORTFOLIOANALYZER_DATABASE=""
POSTGRES_PORTFOLIOANALYZER_PASSWORD=""

```

### Build the Application

Run the provided `build.sh` script to set up the application:

```bash
[ -f .env ] && set -a && source .env && set +a; bash build.sh
```

This will:

1. Load the environment variables declared in `.env` 

2. Build Docker images for the application and its dependencies.

3. Create necessary configuration files for Airflow, PostgreSQL, and Streamlit.

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning:

**If no `.env` file is found, the `build.sh` script will continue and use default values for all environment variables. This may result in insecure credentials.**

### Running the Application

Start the Application
Use Docker Compose to start all services:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

This will start the following services:

| Service           | URL                      | Description                         |
|-------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Streamlit         | http://localhost:8501    | UI for uploading and analyzing data |
| Airflow Webserver | http://localhost:8080    | DAG orchestration and scheduling    |
| PostgreSQL        | http://localhost:5432    | Stores data from stock exchange     |
| Redis             | http://localhost:6379    | Message broker for Airflow          |

Access the Airflow Webser

- Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080.
- Unpause the `get_securities_from_bse` DAG
- Wait for the data ingetion process to complete.
- This will create the `securities` table in the database required by the application.

Access the Streamlit Application

 - Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:8501.
 - On the Home page:
